## What we'll be doing

- Have a dataset on three different species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
- Contains species, measurements on bills and flippers
- Want to learn something about the data
- For example, how the penguins compare
- Or, can we tell the species apart from the measurements we have?

## The bill of a penguin

![Bill or culmen depth](culmen_depth.png){height=80%}

Penguins also have flippers, but you know about those, right?

## Our data (of 344 penguins total)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% select(species, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm) %>% 
  sample_n(12)
```

There are 344 penguins altogether.

## The species

- a so-called "categorical variable" (classified)
- could count how many of each:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% count(species)
```

Or make a graph.

## Bar chart

Best chart for a categorical variable is a bar chart:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height="75%"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) + geom_bar()
```

- each category (species) along the bottom
- how many up the side
- tallest bar has most observations

## Pie chart, if you must


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
penguins %>% 
  count(species) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = species)) + geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
    coord_polar("y", start = 90) +
    theme(axis.title = element_blank())
```

## Flipper length

... is measured, not categorized ("quantitative"):

```{r,echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  select(flipper_length_mm) %>% 
  sample_n(8)
```

## Density plot: Gentoo flipper length

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) + geom_density()
```

## Comments

- most of the Gentoo penguins have flipper length near 215 mm
- there is variability: the flipper lengths vary between about 200 and 230 mm

- how do the other species compare?
- idea: do density plots `overlaid` (in different colours).


## Density plot for all three species

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Comments

- Gentoo penguins have longer flippers than others
- Chinstrap slightly longer than Adelie, but a lot of overlap
- if all you knew was flipper length, you would do reasonably well at distinguishing Gentoo from others.
- but even then, would not be perfect (eg. what if flipper length was 205 mm?)

## Two measured variables: scatterplot

Bill length vs depth for Gentoo:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
penguins %>% filter(species == "Gentoo") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
```

## Comments

- Each dot is one (Gentoo) penguin
- for example, at the bottom left is a penguin with bill length 41 mm and bill depth 13.7 mm
- and at top left, bill length 44 and bill depth 17.3
- usually, a Gentoo penguin with greater bill length also has greater bill depth, but not always

## Bill length vs. depth for all the penguins: a big mess!

```{r, message=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
```

## Bill length vs. depth with species shown

```{r, message=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) + geom_point()
```

## comments

- the species are fairly distinct, eg Adelie have small bill length and large bill depth
- we know that Gentoo have large flipper length, so that plus a small bill depth identifies them
- can we do better? I ran a "classification tree".

## Classification tree

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins.1 <- rpart::rpart(species ~ flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm, data = penguins)
rattle::fancyRpartPlot(penguins.1, type = 5)
# plot(penguins.1, compress = TRUE, uniform = TRUE, margin = 0.1)
# text(penguins.1)
```


## Examples:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rows <- c(50, 202)
penguins %>% 
  select(ends_with("_mm")) %>% 
  slice(rows) %>% mutate(penguin = rows, .before = bill_length_mm)
```

- Penguin 50: 
  - compare flipper length with 207. Less.
  - so compare bill length with 43. Less again.
  - so it's Adelie.
- Penguin 202:
  - compare flipper length with 207. Greater.
  - compare bill depth with 18. Less.
  - so it's Gentoo.

## Were we right?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  slice(rows) %>% 
  mutate(penguin = rows) %>% 
  select(penguin, species)
```

we were!

## to summarize

- variables
  - categorical: something you classify
  - quantitative: something you measure
- graphs
  - bar chart (*not* pie chart) for 1 categorical
  - density plot for 1 quantitative
  - density plots layered to compare such by groups
  - scatterplot for 2 quantitative
  - scatterplot with colours to include groups
- classification tree to understand how groups differ on quantitative variables

these also work for things other than penguins!

## Extra 1: Flipper length vs bill depth

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) + geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 207) + geom_hline(yintercept = 18, linetype = "dashed")
```

## Comments

- Look to right of solid line.
- There are a few Chinstraps with long flippers (top right).
- These are distinguished from Gentoos by bill depth: above dashed line is Chinstrap, below is Gentoo.
- A few  Adelie (red) will be guessed wrong.

## Extra 2: Flipper length vs. bill length

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.height="80%"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, colour = species)) + geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 207) + geom_hline(yintercept = 43, linetype = "dashed")
```

## Comments

- Look to left of solid line.
- The Adelie and Chinstrap have short flippers (left of solid line).
- To tell them apart, look at bill length: Chinstrap longer, Adelie shorter.
- A few Adelie and Chinstrap will get mistaken for each other.
